# Predicting Asteroid Diameter 
### Size matters.... when it comes to asteroids
---

This project involves predicting asteroid diameters based on various orbital data and physical parameters provided by NASA JPL.

During this project, I gained extensive knowledge about analyzing high-dimensional data, fixing skewed data and removing outliers, data correlation, preprocessing pipelines, and explaining black-box models using SHAP values. Check out the report for more information.

I completed this project during my Classification and Regression (CLR204) class last year (Sep 2023).

Technologies used:

1. Data analysis and engineering: **NumPy** and **Pandas**
2. Data visualization and plotting: **Seaborn**
3. Creating preprocessing pipelines and machine learning models: **Scikit-Learn** (might update to PyTorch later)
